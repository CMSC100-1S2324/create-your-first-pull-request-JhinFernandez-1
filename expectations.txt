"My Expectations in CMSC 100"

In CMSC 100, I expect that I will be more proficient when it comes to the concepts included in this course and have my skills developed in web programming. I also expect that the journey of finishing this course will be challenging since programming is something I'm still not good at because sometimes it takes me time to understand some topics. Nevertheless, despite being difficult, I think that I'd still have fun since I will learn a lot of new things.
